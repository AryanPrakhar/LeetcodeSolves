### When to Use Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms are best used when the problem ensures that local optimization leads to global optimization. They are particularly useful for:

- Optimization problems (e.g., finding the minimum or maximum of something)
- Problems where there exists a "greedy choice property" (making a locally optimal choice leads to a global optimum)
- Problems that can be solved by considering a series of choices, where earlier choices provide some guarantees about future outcomes.
